Overview
--------

Circle is a C++ bare metal programming environment for the Raspberry Pi. It should be useable on all existing models (tested on model A+, B, B+, on Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 and on Raspberry Pi Zero). It provides several ready-tested C++ classes which can be used to control different hardware features of the Raspberry Pi. Together with Circle there are delivered some samples which demonstrate the use of its classes.

Circle includes bigger (optional) third-party C-libraries for specific purposes in addon/ now. This is the reason why GitHub rates the project as a C-language-project. The main Circle libraries are written in C++ using classes instead. That's why it is named a C++ programming environment.

The 36th Step
-------------

In this step the class *CUserTimer* has been added to Circle, which implements a fine grained user programmable interrupt timer. It can generate up to 500000 interrupts per second (if used with FIQ).

*CUserTimer* is used in the new *sample/36-softpwm* to implement Software PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), which can be used to control the brightness of a LED or a servo. See the *README* file in this directory for details.

This release of Circle comes with an updated version of the FatFs module (in *addon/fatfs*). Furthermore there have been fixes to the touchscreen driver and the bootloader tools. Finally there are the new system options *SAVE_VFP_REGS_ON_IRQ* and *SAVE_VFP_REGS_ON_FIQ* in *include/circle/sysconfig.h*, which can be enabled if your application uses floating point registers in interrupt handlers.

You may be interested in the [Alpha GDB server](https://github.com/farjump/Alpha_Raspberry_Pi_Circle) by Farjump, which can be used to source-level debug single-core Circle applications with the GNU debugger (GDB).

The options to be used for *cmdline.txt* are described in *doc/cmdline.txt*.

Building
--------

Building is normally done on PC Linux. If building for the Raspberry Pi 1 you need a [toolchain](http://elinux.org/Rpi_Software#ARM) for the ARM1176JZF core (with EABI support). For Raspberry Pi 2/3 you need a toolchain with Cortex-A7/-A53 support. A toolchain, which works for all of these, can be downloaded [here](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads). Circle has been tested with the version *7-2018-q2-update* from this website.

First edit the file *Rules.mk* and set the Raspberry Pi version (*RASPPI*, 1, 2 or 3) and the *PREFIX* of your toolchain commands. Alternatively you can create a *Config.mk* file (which is ignored by git) and set the Raspberry Pi version and the *PREFIX* variable to the prefix of your compiler like this (don't forget the dash at the end):

`RASPPI = 1`  
`PREFIX = arm-none-eabi-`

The following table gives support for selecting the right *RASPPI* value:

| RASPPI | Target         | Models                   | Optimized for |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
|      1 | kernel.img     | A, B, A+, B+, Zero, (CM) | ARM1176JZF-S  |
|      2 | kernel7.img    | 2, 3, (CM3)              | ARMv7-A       |
|      3 | kernel8-32.img | 3, (CM3)                 | Cortex-A53    |

For a binary distribution you should do one build with *RASPPI = 1* and one with *RASPPI = 2* and include the created files *kernel.img* and *kernel7.img*. Optionally you can do a build with *RASPPI = 3* and add the created file *kernel8-32.img* to provide an optimized version for the Raspberry Pi 3.

Then go to the build root of Circle and do:

`./makeall clean`  
`./makeall`

By default only the latest sample (with the highest number) is build. The ready build *kernel.img* file should be in its subdirectory of sample/. If you want to build another sample after `makeall` go to its subdirectory and do `make`.

You can also build Circle on the Raspberry Pi itself on Raspbian but you need some method to put the *kernel.img* file onto the SD(HC) card. With an external USB card reader on model B+ or Raspberry Pi 2/3 model B (4 USB ports) this should be no problem.

Building Circle from a non-Linux host is possible too. Maybe you have to adapt the shell scripts in this case. You need a cross compiler targetting (for example) *arm-none-eabi*. OSDev.org has an [excellent document on the subject](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) that you can follow if you have no idea of what a cross compiler is, or how to make one.

Installation
------------

Copy the Raspberry Pi firmware (from boot/ directory, do *make* there to get them) files along with the kernel.img (from sample/ subdirectory) to a SD(HC) card with FAT file system. Put the SD(HC) card into the Raspberry Pi.

Directories
-----------

* include: The common header files, most class headers are in the include/circle/ subdirectory.
* lib: The Circle class implementation and support files (other libraries are in subdirectories of lib/).
* sample: Several sample applications using Circle in different subdirectories. The main function is implemented in the CKernel class.
* addon: Contains contributed libraries and samples (has to be build manually).
* app: Place your own applications here. If you have own libraries put them into app/lib/.
* boot: Do *make* in this directory to get the Raspberry Pi firmware files required to boot.
* doc: Additional documentation files.
* tools: Some tools for using Circle more comfortable (e.g. a serial bootloader).

Classes
-------

The following C++ classes were added to Circle:

Base library

* CUserTimer: Fine grained user programmable interrupt timer (based on ARM_IRQ_TIMER1)

The available Circle classes are listed in the file *doc/classes.txt*. If you have doxygen installed on your computer you can build a class documentation in *doc/html/* using:

`./makedoc`

At the moment there are only a few classes described in detail for doxygen.
